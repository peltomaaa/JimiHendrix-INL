                    <h2>Are You Experienced?</h2>
                    <h3>Released May 1967</h3>
                    <p>Musicians:</p>
                    <p>Jimi Hendrix, Guitar & Vocals <br>
                        Mitch Mitchell, Drums & Backing vocals <br>

                    <p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in 1967,
                        the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the
                        greatest albums of all time. The album features Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to
                        songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic
                        and rock music.</p>
